        <p>
          In this fast, mechanical era where accidents and injuries are day to day encounters of life,
          where one can be struct in a traumatic situation , urgently in need of blood ,
          with no immediate contacts or sources . This is where we step in ,
          We provide you an easy solution
          <b>EASY BLOOD</b>

        </p>
        <p class="dark">
          The Idea is
          To provide contact details of matching donor nearest to the person in need, to make blood accessible to him
          safely and immediately from a reliable source.
          Now we compare the entered data with a college students database containing the details of all students in
          college like name, blood group, contact number, department, year, hostel number, etc.

      <aside id="sidebar">
        <div class="dark">
          <h3>What We Do</h3>
          <p>First of all we find the students with matching blood group and then
            According to the preference we further classify the students based on their year department and hostel
            number.
            Then we give user the contact details of the matching students.

            The moto here is to provide the user the best possible match in his/her campus and make blood available to
            him safely and securely.
